## Project Overview

This repository is a research experiment project for voxel-based rendering. We plan to implement the following features/components:

- **glTF Viewer**: A rasterization-based glTF viewer
- **Voxelization**: An implementation of a voxelization algorithm to convert triangle meshes into voxels or data structures such as SVOs
- **Appearance Aggregation**: A method to maximize the fidelity of the voxelized scene compared to the original, making the voxelized representation an effective tool for LOD rendering
